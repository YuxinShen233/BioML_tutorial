# BioML tutorial


## Aim
Providing the code for applying and understanding ML for practical biological problems:
- DNA and protein sequence representation
- DNA sequence to protein expression prediction
- Protein sequence-to-function modelling
- Biological motif extraction
- Single-cell analysis and clustering
- Gene networks
- Synthetic gene circuits


## Contents
[0. DNA and protein sequence representation with LLM/foundation model](/0_sequence-embedding-LLM.ipynb)

[1. Simple but useful - linear models](/1_linear-model.ipynb)



## How to use
Machine learning, especially LLM, has large dependency on Python packages. The package requirement can be installed through the following command:
<pre> pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>


## From the author
As a PhD student applying machine learning to the fascinating biological systems (and from a non-ML and non-biology background), I want to share what I've learnt during my PhD, either from my PhD project or from some exploration. 

Writing and sharing are also ways of learning. Good luck for our onward journey!
