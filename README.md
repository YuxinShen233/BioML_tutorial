# BioML tutorial


## Aim
Providing the code for applying and understanding ML for practical biological problems.
- DNA sequence to protein expression prediction
- Protein sequence-to-function modelling
- Biological motif extraction
- DNA and protein sequence representation
- Single-cell analysis and clustering
- Gene networks
- Synthetic gene circuits


## Contents
[1. DNA sequence to protein expression models](/1_STE-model.ipynb)

[2. DNA and protein sequence representation with LLM/foundation model](/2_sequence-embedding-LLM.ipynb)


## How to use
Machine learning, especially LLM, has large . With conda installed, the package requirement can be installed through the following:



## From the author
As a PhD student applying machine learning to the fascinating biological systems, I want to share what I've learnt during my PhD, either from my PhD project or from some exploration. 

Writing and sharing are also ways of learning. Good luck for our onward journey!
