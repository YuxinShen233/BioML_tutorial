# BioML tutorial


## Aim
Providing the code for applying and understanding ML for the following practical biological problems:
- DNA and protein sequence representation
- Sequence to fitness prediction
- Single-cell analysis and clustering
- Sequence optimization
- Explainable AI in biology
- Embedding of chemical structure
- Sturcutral biology


## Contents
The contents are mainly arranged by different ML algorithms:

[0. DNA and protein sequence representation with LLM/foundation model](/0_sequence-embedding-LLM.ipynb)

[1. Simple but useful - linear models](/1_linear-model.ipynb)

[2. Nonlinear models: RF, SVR and MLP](/2_nonlinear-model.ipynb)

[3. Deep Learning models](/3_DL-model.ipynb)

[4. Single-cell transcriptomic and multiomics](/4_single-cell.ipynb)

[5. Spatial omics](/5_spatial-omics.ipynb) (using uv environment)

## How to use
Machine learning, especially LLM, has large dependency on Python packages. The package requirement can be installed through the following command:
<pre> conda env create -f environment.yml</pre>


## From the author
As a PhD student applying machine learning to the fascinating biological systems (and from a non-ML and non-biology background), I want to share what I've learnt during my PhD, either from my PhD project or from some exploration. 

Writing and sharing are also ways of learning. Good luck for our onward journey!
